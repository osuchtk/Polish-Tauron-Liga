# Polish-Tauron-Liga
Projekt in≈ºynierski - Analiza i wizualizacja statystyk siatkarskich / Engineering project - analysis and visualization of volleyball statistics

My main goal was to download and visualize volleyball statistics. In order to do this I scraped data from Tauron Liga websites. I used data about players, team standings and typical match statictics. All informations is saved in csv files and then uploaded to my local  MariaDB database. In Power BI I connect to my database and prepare visualization.
